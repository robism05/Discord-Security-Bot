# Discord-Security-Bot

The purpose of the project is to be able to control features of my MacBook through any other devices that are using discord so long as the bot is online and is connected to a discord server. From there commands can be entered, such as "!screenshot", which will take a picture of the screen and send it to the server.

The code hasn't been maintained for a while and is a horrible jumbly mess. I do like the idea however, so I plan to greatly improve it's use whenever I find the time.

This repository will now be archived.
